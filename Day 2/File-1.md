# Three Models of cloud services : 		
* SaaS (Software as a Srvice)
* PaaS (Platform as a Service)
* IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)


**SaaS**
	
- Different softwares are provided directly, no need to download and install at client side.
- User is not responsible for hardware or software update.
- Can be used for short term projects that require quick and affordable collaboration. 

### There are two keys:

- SaaS deployments donâ€™t require extensive hardware.

- SaaS systems are typically paid within a subscription model.

Examples : 
	1) Tableau, 
	2) Splunk,
	3) Storm,etc.

**PaaS**

* Instead of providing software, it provides platform for software creation.
* A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure.
* Developer has to focus only on software development without the worrying about Operating system, Storage etc

Examples :
	1) Hosted db RDS,
	2) AWS Elastic Beanstalk,etc.
