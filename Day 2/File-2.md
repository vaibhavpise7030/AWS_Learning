**AWS Firewall : Security Groups**

![Security group](C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Security group.png)

- 2 Sets of rules:
	1. Inbound	    - Controls incoming traffic
	2. Outbound  - Controls outgoing traffic 

- These rules can be used for open/close port while remotely accessing the system.
- We can create different security groups and can manage ports.
- We can use same security group for different instances if needed or can create new group for new instance.
